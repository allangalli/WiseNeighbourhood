# ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Toronto Police MCI Project - Survey Intake Code

This repository is Part 1 of the "SixSafety" system, which is the survey-intake. <br>
The survey, built on Streamlit, leverages an LLM Agentic Framework to dynamically ask questions to gain clarification on the "crime" type area that users would like to receive safety recommendations.<br>
Once the survey results are retrieved, they are passed onto Part 2, which is the LLM Safety Plan generation. <br>

The second part of the code, the LLM Safety Plan generation, may be found here: https://github.com/TangoMango223/MMAI5040_TP_Model
