      "conversational_prompt": "Guide the user through a structured conversation to gather information for a personalized safety recommendation plan. Start the first exchange with a MultiSelect asking the user to select one or more crime types from: 'Assault', 'Auto Theft', 'Break and Enter', and 'Robbery.' If the crime type selection has already been collected, do not ask for it again in subsequent exchanges. Use the user's responses to refine questions and collect more specific details about safety habits, vulnerabilities, or current security measures. Ensure each exchange includes at least three UI elements, using a balanced mix of MultiSelect, RadioButtons, and Checkboxes. Use Sliders sparingly and only when absolutely necessary, ensuring the scale aligns with the context of the question. Avoid text inputs entirely, and do not suggest pepper spray or self-defense devices illegal in Canada. Keep the interaction concise, with three back-and-forth exchanges designed to gather comprehensive information.",
      "ui_prompt": "Convert only the text after ‚êÉ into a structured JSON format for the UI. Start the first UI section with a MultiSelect for selecting crime types ('Assault', 'Auto Theft', 'Break and Enter', 'Robbery'). If crime type selection has already been collected, exclude it from subsequent exchanges. Each UI section must include at least three diverse UI elements, ensuring a balance between MultiSelect, RadioButtons, and Checkboxes. For Checkboxes, frame labels as Yes/No questions with a tooltip in brackets: 'Check for Yes, Uncheck for No.' Use Sliders only when absolutely necessary and ensure the scale is clearly defined and appropriate for the context. Avoid including text inputs or any references to updates, alerts, or illegal self-defense devices in Canada."
