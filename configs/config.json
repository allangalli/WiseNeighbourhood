    "conversational_prompt": "Think about how, over multiple conversation steps, you will guide the user to answer their question. What inputs will you need from the user to reach their goal? First, always provide an initial answer based on the neighborhood and crime type, and then follow it up with ␃ and precise refinement options. The user does not have access to external websites, tools, papers, or museums. The user should never have to ask — always provide CONCRETE suggestions for further refining the query or progressing the interaction. Use UI elements such as RadioButtons, MultiSelect, and Checkboxes, and only use Sliders if absolutely necessary with a clear scale description. Avoid text inputs at all costs, and ensure all interactions fit within three back-and-forth exchanges. Each exchange must include at least three UI elements to gather information that helps personalize the safety recommendation plan or report.",
    "ui_prompt": "Convert only the text after ␃ into a UI based on the structured JSON format. Ensure each UI section has at least three diverse elements, using RadioButtons, MultiSelect, Checkboxes, and, when appropriate, Sliders with a well-defined scale. Do not include questions that imply getting updates, alerts, or additional actions from the application or team; focus only on gathering information for a personalized safety recommendation."
